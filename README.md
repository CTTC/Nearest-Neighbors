# Nearest-Neighbors

These two notebooks coded the algorithms talked in the [Machine Learning: Clustering and Retrieval] Course(https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval/home/welcome)

```Nearest-neighbors-features-and-metrics```

The goal of this notebook is to 
* gain intuition for different notions of similarity and practice finding similar documents. 
* explore the tradeoffs with representing documents using raw word counts and TF-IDF
* explore the behavior of different distance metrics by looking at the Wikipedia pages most similar to President Obama’s page.

```Nearest-neighbors-lsh-implementation```

The goal of this notebook is to 
* implement the LSH(Locality Sensitive Hashing) algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search
* examine the accuracy for different documents by comparing against brute force search, and also contrast runtimes
* explore the role of the algorithm’s tuning parameters in the accuracy of the method
