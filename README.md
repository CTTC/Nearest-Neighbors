# Nearest-Neighbors

---
These two notebooks coded the algorithms talked in the [Machine Learning: Clustering and Retrieval] Course(https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-clustering-and-retrieval/home/welcome)

---
**Nearest-neighbors-features-and-metrics**

The goal of this notebook is to:
* gain intuition for different notions of similarity and practice finding similar documents. 
* explore the tradeoffs with representing documents using raw word counts and TF-IDF
* explore the behavior of different distance metrics by looking at the Wikipedia pages most similar to President Obama’s page.

**Nearest-neighbors-lsh-implementation**

The goal of this notebook is to:
* implement the LSH(Locality Sensitive Hashing) algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search
* examine the accuracy for different documents by comparing against brute force search, and also contrast runtimes
* explore the role of the algorithm’s tuning parameters in the accuracy of the method

**kmeans-with-text-data**

The goal of this notebook is to :
* cluster Wikipedia documents using k-means (self-coded)
* explore the role of random initialization on the quality of the clustering
* use k-means++ to provide a smart initialization for centroids
* explore how results differ after changing the number of clusters
* evaluate clustering, both quantitatively and qualitatively
